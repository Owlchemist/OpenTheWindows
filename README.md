# [JPT] Open The Windows!
Natural Light for RimWorld

  This is for those players who have already grown a little too comfortable with their base designs and are able to handle a whole new requirement for a colony's efficiency. This new variable is <b>natural light</b>. Your pawns are going to crave it, and the only way you can provide is by opening holes on your walls and installing state-of-the-art devices known as... windows! 
  
  Sure, you can always spread lamps around your underground bunker and cut yourself off from nature's light cycles. The game already penalizes this with the <i>outdoor</i> need. What this mod does is ramp up the rate at which your pawns crave the outdoors. They will start to feel <i>entombed</i> much sooner. Unless, of course, the space they live in is bathed in natural light, day and night. In order to do that, be prepared to set aside some land, because the windows can only pump light in if they have acess to wide open areas. So say goodbye to the infinite hallways of rooms glued to one another and welcome to the real-world architecture needs!
  
  But there's more. If you also play with [Nature is Beautiful](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1530259312) on, your windows will double as a pretty useful aesthetic device. Their beauty stat will become the sum of all the beauty in their outside field of view. This means your rooms will actually benefit from having a garden next door! In order to balance the game so it doesn't get too easy with the added beauty, we reduced slightly the pawns' sensitivity for beauty. This, as well as the added natural light requirement, are customizable on the mod's options panel, so you can totally have it your way!
  
  Have fun!
