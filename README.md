# [JPT] Open The Windows!
Natural Light for RimWorld

[i]Introducing a revolutionary device to illuminate, ventilate and defend your base: the [b]WINDOW[/b]!
Your base designs are never going to be same.[/i]

[h2]Let [b]natural light[/b] in![/h2] Once your pawns realize they've been cut off from nature's light cycles, they're going to crave it! The outdoors need levels are going to decay 3x faster* if they are stuck indoors without windows. You better plan well! Be prepared to set aside some land, because the windows can only pump light in if they have acess to wide open areas. So say goodbye to the infinite hallways of rooms glued to one another in unhealty bunkers and welcome to the real-world architecture needs! Also, if you are playing with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=833899765]Dubs Skylights[/url], all light coming from your skylights count as natural light.

[h2]Circulate [b]air[/b]![/h2] Your windows can act as vents. But you will need to research glass-making before you can build windows that can filter air or light independently. More advanced windows can ventilate even with their shutters closed, even if at a lower rate. If you're playing with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=826153738]Glass+Lights[/url], all research and production chains will be integrated (and it's windows are replaced for these ones).

[h2][b]Shoot[/b] through the windows![/h2] Who needs embrasures when you can use a window that opens and closes? That's right: your pawns can shoot while ducking behind a window, with a cover value equivalent to sandbags. When the enemies get too close, the window can be closed and it will become equivalent to a wall. Let them come! Of course, they might decide to charge the windows themselves, and they are weaker than a regular wall. You might find yourself with a breach on your hands! Of course, there's a fortified window you can install on more sensitive locations, but they won't come cheap.

[h2]Enjoy [b]beautiful[/b] landscapes![/h2] If you're playing with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1530259312]Nature is Beautiful[/url] (or it's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1551147619]rebalanced version[/url]), the windows will calculate their own beauty stat by summing up all the beauty on their outside field of view. This means your rooms will actually benefit from having a garden next door! For balancing reasons, we've inculded a "beauty sensitivity reduction" factor*.

* These adjustments are customizable on the mod's options panel, so you can totally have it your way!

[h2]Ongoing Development[/h2]
Even if it's already 100% playable, there will always be room for improvement. If you find any errors, please let us know [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/1971860929/3345546435393929815/]here[/url]. Beyond that, we welcome any suggestions we can add to our list of future features!

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
You can safely add this to your saved game. About other mods, we simply cannot test it with every one out there. All we can do is design for maximum compatibility and hope for the best. If you're unsure, please give it a shot. If you stumble on any problem, let us know and we'll do what we can to fix it
