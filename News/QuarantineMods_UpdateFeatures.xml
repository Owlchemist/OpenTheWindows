      |&lt;i&gt;Are you playing while locked down in social isolation? Good! Because I'm taking this time to make RinWorld mods... and I need your help!&lt;/i&gt;
      |Hi, I'm JP, author of &lt;i&gt;Open The Windows, Soft Warm Beds&lt;/i&gt; and other mods. Like many people around the world, my living has been impacted by the global efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. I'm trying to stay clear of cabin fever and turn this into something productive. So I've been making mods! Now I'm putting up this one-time campaign on my Ko-Fi page as an incentive for those who are able to help me get through this.  
      |&lt;b&gt;I have three brand new mods that are ready to go&lt;/b&gt;, and I'll release them as donations reach three modest goals. And hey, coffee is cheap! If only a fraction of &lt;i&gt;Open The Windows&lt;/i&gt; subscribers decide to take action, these mods will be out before we know it! 
      |Follow the link above or go to https://ko-fi.com/jptrrs to contribute &amp; check more details.
      |You can contact me anytime, on Ko-Fi or on Steam. Many, many thanks for your support!
      |&lt;b&gt;Now go on, your colonists also need you! Have Fun!&lt;/b&gt;
